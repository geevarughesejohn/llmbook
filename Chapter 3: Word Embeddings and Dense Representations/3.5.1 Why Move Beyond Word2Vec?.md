## **3.5.1 Why Move Beyond Word2Vec?**

Word2Vec was a major step forward in turning words into meaningful vectors, but like all great innovations, it came with its own set of **limitations**. These limits didn’t matter at first—they were easy to overlook, especially compared to what came before. But as the field matured and expectations rose, cracks started to show.

Let’s unpack the core issues that pushed researchers to go beyond Word2Vec.

### 🔁 **One Word, One Vector — Always**

In Word2Vec, every word has exactly **one vector**, no matter how it's used.

Take the word **“bank”**:

* In “She deposited money in the **bank**,” it refers to a financial institution.
* In “He sat on the **bank** of the river,” it means the edge of a river.

Same spelling, completely different meaning.

But Word2Vec doesn’t know that. It assigns **one vector** to “bank,” blending both meanings. That means the model:

* Struggles with **polysemy** (words with multiple meanings)
* Can’t distinguish **usage based on context**

In natural language, context is everything. And Word2Vec, while good at generalizing, just isn’t equipped to handle that kind of nuance.

### ❌ **No Understanding of Subwords**

Let’s say you train Word2Vec on English text. It learns the word “run,” but never sees “running” or “runner.”
What happens?

It treats each form of the word as completely different—even though they clearly share meaning.

This becomes a serious problem with:

* **Rare words** (appearing only a few times)
* **Misspellings or typos**
* **Morphologically rich languages** (e.g., Finnish, Turkish)

Since Word2Vec sees words as **atomic tokens**, it can’t break them down. It lacks the ability to say, “Ah, ‘unhappiness’ contains the root ‘happy’.”

This means the model has:

* **Poor generalization to unseen words**
* Redundant or sparse embeddings for similar word forms

---

### 🧠 **Ignores Word Order (and Structure)**

CBOW, for instance, just averages surrounding word vectors. This is fast—but it **ignores the order** of the words.

Consider:

* “Dog bites man”
* “Man bites dog”

Word2Vec treats the context as a **bag of words**—so these could look almost the same to the model. But clearly, the meaning has changed dramatically!

While Skip-Gram preserves some directional sense, neither CBOW nor Skip-Gram captures **sentence structure** or **syntax** effectively.

### 💬 **Static, Shallow, Context-Blind**

To sum up, Word2Vec's weaknesses come down to three main points:

| Weakness                 | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One vector per word**  | Can’t handle multiple meanings                             |
| **No subword awareness** | Struggles with new, rare, or morphologically complex words |
| **No context awareness** | Meaning doesn’t adapt to how a word is used in a sentence  |

These shortcomings opened the door for the next wave of embedding techniques—ones that could:

* Capture **subword structure**
* Incorporate **global statistics**
* And most importantly: **adapt to context**

In the next sections, we’ll look at how **FastText**, **GloVe**, and later **contextual models** tackled these problems and brought word embeddings to the next level.
