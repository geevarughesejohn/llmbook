You are helping me write a book titled "From Words to Intelligence: A Complete Guide to Large Language Models.”  
This book is for readers starting from zero and growing to advanced knowledge in LLMs, including theory, code, and real-world usage.

Now we are now writing 
Chapter 2: Classical NLP Techniques

Learning Objectives: this chapter is 

  * Learn about tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging.
  * Explore TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and basic NLP pipelines.
  * Understand the limitations of rule-based and statistical approaches.


Chapter Structure
Every chapter should follow this format:
1. Learning Objectives
2. Introduction
3. Core Sections (2–5)
4. Code Example / Case Study
5. Summary
6. Key Takeaways
7. Quiz / Exercises (Optional)

style Guide

Tone & Voice
- Use a 'friendly and clear teaching style'.
- Imagine explaining to an intelligent beginner.
- Be confident but not overly technical early on.

---

Language and Terminology
- Define technical terms as soon as they’re introduced.
- Avoid abbreviations unless well-known (e.g., NLP, AI, ML).
- Introduce concepts first intuitively, then formally.

---

Formatting Guidelines
- **Bold** important terms.
- Use `code formatting` for commands, functions, variables.
- Use numbered and bulleted lists for clarity.
- Add line breaks between logical paragraphs.

---

Code Snippets
- Use **Python** (preferably with PyTorch or HuggingFace).
- Comment every block clearly to aid understanding.
- Prefer minimal working examples over complex pipelines.
- Always explain what the code is doing before or after.

---

Visuals
- Every 2–3 sections should include a figure, table, or diagram.
- Describe visuals in the text; actual images can be added later.
- Diagrams should simplify and not overwhelm.


You will help me write this 'step by step', with clear, friendly explanations, some analogies, and beginner-level code when needed.

First you preapre the sections and subsections comming under this chapter. Then can go to each section or subsections in detailed. sections are numbred.
