## 7. **Summary**

In this chapter, we took our **first step into the world of language models** by understanding what it means to “model language.”

We began with the basic idea: a language model tries to **predict the next word or phrase** based on what has already been written or said. This seemingly simple task hides a lot of complexity due to the **ambiguous, contextual, and evolving nature of human language**.

We then walked through how the field of language modeling has **evolved over time**:

* From **rule-based systems** that relied on hand-crafted grammar,
* To **statistical models** like n-grams that learned from frequency patterns,
* And finally, to **neural network models** that learn deep meaning and structure from massive datasets.

We also saw why **language is hard** to model: ambiguity, long-range context, sarcasm, world knowledge, and constant change make it a truly challenging AI problem.

Finally, we built a **tiny predictive language model using bigrams**, showing how early models were constructed and how prediction from context works—even at the simplest level.
