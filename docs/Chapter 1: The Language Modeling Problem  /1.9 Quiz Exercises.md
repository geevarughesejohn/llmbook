### ðŸ§ª Coding Exercise

**Build a trigram model!**

Modify the bigram code from earlier to create a **trigram model** that uses the previous **two** words to predict the next word.

Hint: Youâ€™ll need to store keys as word pairs, like `("I", "love")`, and look up the third word from there.

```python
# Your starter code
corpus = [
    "I love deep learning",
    "I love machine learning",
    "deep learning is fun",
    "machine learning is powerful"
]

# Your task:
# 1. Build trigram_model where key = (word1, word2), value = list of next words
# 2. Predict the next word given a word pair like ("I", "love")
```
