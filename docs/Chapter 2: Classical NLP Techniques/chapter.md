## üìò Chapter 2: Classical NLP Techniques

### **1. Learning Objectives**

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Understand the foundations of how machines process and analyze language.
* Learn about **tokenization**, **stemming**, **lemmatization**, and **part-of-speech (POS) tagging**.
* Explore **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF**, and how they help in text representation.
* Understand how rule-based and statistical NLP pipelines work.
* Recognize the limitations of classical NLP approaches and why more advanced models became necessary.
