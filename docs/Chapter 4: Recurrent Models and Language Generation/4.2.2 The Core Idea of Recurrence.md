## **4.2.2 The Core Idea of Recurrence**

At the heart of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a simple but powerful idea: **what you’ve already seen should help you understand what comes next**.

Let’s break that down.

In a standard feedforward neural network, you give the model an input, it processes that input, and then it produces an output. Done. It doesn’t remember anything about what came before. That’s fine for tasks where each input is independent—like identifying whether an image contains a cat or not—but it doesn’t work well for language, where meaning **depends on history**.

RNNs fix this by introducing a concept called a **hidden state**. Think of it as the model’s **memory**. At each step in a sequence, the RNN updates this memory based on two things:

1. The **current input** (the word it’s reading now)
2. The **previous hidden state** (its memory from the past)

Together, these allow the RNN to form a new understanding of the sentence so far.

### 🧠 A Little Math (Gently Introduced)

Let’s say we’re processing a sentence word by word. At time step `t`, the RNN receives:

* The input word vector: $x_t$
* The previous hidden state: $h_{t-1}$

It then computes the new hidden state $h_t$ like this:

$$
h_t = \tanh(W \cdot x_t + U \cdot h_{t-1} + b)
$$

Here’s what that means:

* $W$ is a weight matrix that transforms the input
* $U$ is another matrix that transforms the hidden state
* $b$ is a bias term
* $\tanh$ is the activation function that squashes values between –1 and 1

Each time the RNN reads a new word, it blends that word with its current memory, updates its hidden state, and passes it forward.

You can visualize it like this:

```
x_t ──▶[ RNN Cell ]──▶ h_t
       ▲       │
       │       ▼
     h_{t-1}  Output
```

Each **RNN Cell** has a loop inside it—this is what allows it to carry memory from one step to the next. It’s why we call it *recurrent*.

### 📚 Analogy: Reading a Story

Imagine reading a mystery novel. As each new clue is revealed, you update your mental model of who might be the culprit. That internal model—the accumulation of everything you’ve read so far—is like the RNN’s hidden state. Each new piece of information (a sentence or paragraph) modifies your understanding just a bit. You don’t forget everything that came before—you build on it.

### 🧩 Why It Matters

This structure allows the RNN to **capture patterns over time**. It can learn that “The cat sat on the” is likely to be followed by “mat,” or that the phrase “I am feeling very” could lead to “happy,” “sad,” or “tired” depending on the context.

But while this idea of recurrence is powerful, it's not without flaws. As sequences grow longer, the RNN’s memory begins to fade. It becomes harder for the model to carry meaningful signals across many steps—a problem we’ll explore in a later section on **vanishing gradients**.

Before we get there, let’s first look at how RNNs work when you process **an entire sentence**, one word at a time. That’s what we’ll cover next in **4.2.3: Unrolling an RNN Over Time**.
