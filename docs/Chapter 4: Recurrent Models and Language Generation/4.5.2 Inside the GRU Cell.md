*A simpler, elegant memory design*

If the LSTM is a memory system with three levers and two compartments, the **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** simplifies everything down to just **two levers** and **a single memory track**. And yet, it still manages to remember and forget, learn and adapt—often just as well.

Let’s look inside a GRU cell to understand how this streamlined mechanism works.

---

### 🧠 One Memory Track: Hidden State Only

Unlike the LSTM, the GRU has **no separate cell state**. Instead, it keeps everything it needs in a single **hidden state** $h_t$. This hidden state is updated at each time step using two gates:

* The **Update Gate** $z_t$
* The **Reset Gate** $r_t$

Let’s break these down.

---

### 🔄 Update Gate $z_t$: Control What to Keep

The **update gate** determines how much of the **past** should be kept around and how much should be replaced by the **new** information.

The formula is:

$$
z_t = \sigma(W_z x_t + U_z h_{t-1} + b_z)
$$

Where:

* $x_t$: input at time step $t$
* $h_{t-1}$: previous hidden state
* $\sigma$: sigmoid activation (values between 0 and 1)

**Intuition:**
If $z_t \approx 1$, we mostly keep the past memory.
If $z_t \approx 0$, we replace it with new information.

---

### ♻️ Reset Gate $r_t$: Control How to Mix the Past

The **reset gate** decides how much of the past hidden state should be considered when generating new information.

$$
r_t = \sigma(W_r x_t + U_r h_{t-1} + b_r)
$$

This gate lets the GRU **"forget"** parts of the previous state when appropriate—especially helpful in dealing with noise or irrelevant past input.

---

### ⚙️ Candidate Hidden State $\tilde{h}_t$: The New Memory

Once the gates are computed, the GRU calculates a **candidate** hidden state $\tilde{h}_t$ based on the current input and a **modified** past:

$$
\tilde{h}_t = \tanh(W_h x_t + U_h (r_t \odot h_{t-1}) + b_h)
$$

* $r_t \odot h_{t-1}$: this is a filtered version of the past, shaped by the reset gate
* $\tanh$: ensures the output values stay in a manageable range

---

### 🧾 Final Step: Update the Hidden State $h_t$

The final hidden state is computed by **interpolating** between the old and new memory using the update gate:

$$
h_t = (1 - z_t) \odot h_{t-1} + z_t \odot \tilde{h}_t
$$

**Interpretation:**

* If the update gate $z_t$ is high → we mostly use the **new** information.
* If $z_t$ is low → we mostly **retain** the previous memory.

This formula is elegant: it’s just a **weighted average** of the past and present.

---

### 📚 Analogy: Thoughtful Updating

Imagine you're editing a live document:

* The **reset gate** decides how much of the earlier draft to look at.
* The **update gate** decides whether to **keep** what you had or **replace** it with what you just wrote.

In some sentences, you only tweak a few words (low update). In others, you rewrite everything (high update). The GRU behaves similarly.

### 🔁 Summary of GRU Flow

Here’s a quick recap of the GRU’s internal steps:

1. Compute **update** and **reset** gates from input and past state.
2. Use reset gate to filter old memory.
3. Generate candidate memory from input and modified past.
4. Use update gate to blend old and new memory into the new state.

All of this happens **within a single hidden state**, which is passed along through time.

In the next section, we’ll compare this simplified design to the LSTM and explore when to use each one.
