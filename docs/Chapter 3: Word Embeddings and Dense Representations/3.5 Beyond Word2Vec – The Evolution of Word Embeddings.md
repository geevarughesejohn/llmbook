## **3.5 Beyond Word2Vec – The Evolution of Word Embeddings**

When Word2Vec arrived on the scene, it changed the way we approached language in machine learning. It gave us a powerful, intuitive way to turn words into numbers—and those numbers captured surprisingly deep relationships.

But as with any breakthrough, **new limitations appeared** as the field evolved:

* What if a word has **multiple meanings**?
* What if the model sees a word **it has never seen before**?
* What if we need to understand **subtle variations** in word forms like “run,” “running,” and “ran”?

Word2Vec gave us a solid foundation, but it still treated words as **isolated units**, assigning **one vector per word**, regardless of how it’s used in a sentence.

That’s where the next generation of embeddings came in.

In this section, we’ll explore how researchers tackled these challenges with smarter, more flexible models:

* **FastText** improved Word2Vec by breaking words into **character n-grams**, allowing it to generalize to rare or unseen words.
* **GloVe** took a different route, combining **global word co-occurrence statistics** with vector training for richer representations.
* And finally, we’ll get a glimpse of **contextual embeddings**—like **ELMo** and **BERT**—that changed everything by learning not just what a word means, but **what it means right now**, in this sentence, in this context.

This section is the bridge between the classical world of static embeddings and the dynamic world of modern large language models. It shows how our understanding of words—and how we represent them—evolved rapidly over just a few years.
