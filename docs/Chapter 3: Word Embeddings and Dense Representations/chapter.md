## **Chapter 3: Word Embeddings and Dense Representations**

This is the turning point in your reader’s journey—from basic NLP to the foundational ideas that power **modern language models**.

---

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this chapter, the reader will:

* Understand what **word embeddings** are and why they’re essential.
* Learn how embeddings differ from classical approaches like TF-IDF.
* Explore popular embedding models: **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText**.
* See how embeddings capture **semantic meaning and relationships**.
* Use pre-trained embeddings in real code examples.
* Understand the limitations of word-level embeddings and the motivation for **contextual embeddings** (leading into Chapter 4).

---

### 🧱 **Chapter Structure and Sections**

---

### **3.1 Introduction: From Counting Words to Capturing Meaning**

* Recap the limitations of TF-IDF and BoW: sparsity, no meaning, no order.
* Introduce the idea of representing words in a **dense**, **low-dimensional** vector space.
* Explain the big idea: words with **similar meanings** have **similar vectors**.
* Set up the motivation for learning semantic word embeddings.

---

### **3.2 What Are Word Embeddings?**

* Define **word embeddings** in simple terms.
* Explain how each word is mapped to a **dense vector of real numbers**.
* Compare sparse vs. dense vectors (visual or table).
* Use analogy: “embeddings are to words what coordinates are to locations.”

---

### **3.3 Properties of Embedding Spaces**

* **Semantic closeness**: similar words are close together.
* **Direction and distance** capture relationships (e.g., *man → woman*, *king → queen*).
* Introduce famous vector analogy:
  `king - man + woman ≈ queen`
* Visual examples using 2D or 3D projected spaces (mention PCA or t-SNE).
* Discuss cosine similarity intuitively.

---

### **3.4 Word2Vec: Learning Embeddings from Context**

* Introduce **Word2Vec** (by Google, 2013).
* Explain the two architectures:

  * **CBOW** (Continuous Bag of Words)
  * **Skip-gram**
* Intuition: “You shall know a word by the company it keeps.”
* Explain how context windows work.
* Show simplified training process (without deep math).
* Highlight Word2Vec’s unsupervised nature.

---

### **3.5 GloVe: Embeddings from Global Co-occurrence**

* Introduce **GloVe** (Global Vectors for Word Representation by Stanford).
* Explain how it differs from Word2Vec:

  * Word2Vec is predictive
  * GloVe is count-based
* Intuition: builds a co-occurrence matrix and factorizes it.
* Pros and cons of this approach.

---

### **3.6 FastText: Subword-Level Embeddings**

* Explain how **FastText** improves over Word2Vec.
* Adds subword (character n-gram) information:

  * Helps with rare words, typos, and morphology.
* Especially useful for morphologically rich languages (e.g., German, Hindi).

---

### **3.7 Code Example: Using Pretrained Word Embeddings**

* Load pretrained vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) using `gensim` or Hugging Face.
* Show how to:

  * Load a model
  * Get the vector for a word
  * Measure similarity between words
  * Visualize using `matplotlib` or `sklearn.manifold.TSNE`
* Optional: small sentiment classifier using averaged word embeddings

---

### **3.8 Limitations of Word Embeddings**

* No understanding of **context**:

  * “bank” in “river bank” vs. “savings bank” has same vector
* Embeddings are **static** once trained
* OOV (Out-of-vocabulary) problem: can’t handle new words unless subword info is used
* No sense of sentence-level meaning or syntax

---

### **3.9 What Comes Next: Contextual Embeddings**

* Preview of next chapter
* Mention BERT, ELMo, GPT as models that create **context-aware embeddings**
* Tease the idea: “The meaning of a word changes depending on the sentence.”

---

### 📌 Optional Sidebar/Boxes to Include

* 📦 **Glossary**: vector, cosine similarity, context window, co-occurrence
* 🧪 **Try This**: Use gensim to find top 5 similar words
* 💡 **Visual Idea**: Show 2D embedding clusters for related words (e.g., countries, sports, emotions)

---

### 📘 Summary and Takeaways

* Word embeddings give us dense, meaningful representations of words.
* Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText were revolutionary in NLP.
* These embeddings enable machines to understand relationships and similarities between words.
* But they’re still limited—they don’t know about **context**.
* That sets the stage for the next big leap: **contextual language models**.
