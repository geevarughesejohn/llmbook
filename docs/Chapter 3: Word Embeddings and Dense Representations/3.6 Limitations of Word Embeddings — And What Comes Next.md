## **3.6 Limitations of Word Embeddings — And What Comes Next**

Word embeddings like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText** helped transform raw text into numbers that machines could understand. They captured surprisingly rich relationships—analogies like “king - man + woman ≈ queen” amazed even researchers.

But they’re not the end of the story.

As we used them more deeply, we began to notice cracks—fundamental limitations that prevented them from fully modeling language like a human would.

Let’s walk through where word embeddings fall short.

---

### 🧠 1. No Understanding of Context

The word **“bank”** is a classic example:

* “He sat by the **river bank**.”
* “She deposited cash in the **savings bank**.”

A human immediately knows these are different meanings. But to Word2Vec or GloVe, “bank” has one vector—used in every situation.

This is because traditional embeddings are **context-free**:

> A word always means the same thing, no matter where it appears.

And that’s just not how language works.

---

### 📦 2. Static and Frozen

Once word embeddings are trained, they’re **static**:

* “Running” will always be mapped to the same vector.
* The model can’t learn new meanings or adapt to changing usage.
* If the language or domain evolves (e.g., slang, memes, technical terms), your embeddings quickly become outdated.

They don’t **grow** with the task or adjust based on sentence structure.

### 🚫 3. The OOV Problem

**OOV** stands for **Out-of-Vocabulary**—and it’s a big issue in NLP.

If your model never saw the word “cryptocurrency” during training, it has no idea what it is. Word2Vec and GloVe will simply fail.

FastText helps a bit by using subwords, but even then, it's more of a patch than a full solution.

---

### 🧩 4. No Sentence-Level Understanding

Word embeddings operate at the **individual word level**. There’s no mechanism for understanding:

* **Sentence structure**
* **Grammar**
* **Long-range relationships between words**

So while “the cat sat on the mat” and “the mat sat on the cat” use the same words, the meaning flips—but the embeddings stay nearly the same.

---

## 🔮 What Comes Next: Contextual Embeddings

To overcome these problems, a new generation of models emerged—ones that don’t assign words fixed vectors but **dynamically adjust based on context**.

This new class is known as **contextual embeddings**, and it includes some of the most important models in modern NLP:

* **ELMo** (Embeddings from Language Models): Early contextual model using bidirectional LSTMs
* **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): Learns rich word representations by looking at both sides of a word
* **GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): Learns meaning through large-scale autoregressive prediction

These models answer the question:

> “What does this word mean **in this sentence**?”

They are **deep**, **context-aware**, and form the core of most modern language systems—including the Large Language Models that power tools like ChatGPT.

### 🌱 A Tease of What’s Ahead

In the next chapter, we’ll explore:

* What makes contextual embeddings different (and powerful)
* How models like BERT and GPT learn to understand sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents
* The **transformer architecture** that changed NLP forever

We’re moving from **word-level understanding** to **language-level intelligence**.
